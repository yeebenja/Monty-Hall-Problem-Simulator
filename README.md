Simulates the Monty Hall Problem. The user can edit the number trials it runs. The program runs both cases where...
1. The game show participant switches choices after Monty reveals a door
2. The game show participant commits with their initial choice

The percentage of times the participant wins a car in both cases is then recorded and reported to the user.
