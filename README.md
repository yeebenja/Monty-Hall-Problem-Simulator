Simulates the Monty Hall Problem. The program uses maps to model the "doors" in the Monty Hall Problem and automatically switches choices or keeps original choice. The user can edit the number trials it runs. The program runs both cases where...
1. The game show participant switches choices after Monty reveals a door
2. The game show participant commits with their initial choice

The percentage of times the participant wins a car in both cases is then recorded and reported to the user.
