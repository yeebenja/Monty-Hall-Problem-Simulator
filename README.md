# Monty-Hall-Problem-Simulator
Simulates the Monty Hall Problem. The user can edit the number trials it runs. The program runs both cases where...
1. The game show participant switches choices after Monty reveals a door
2. The game show participant commits with their initial choice

The percentage of times the participant wins in both cases is recorded and then the program ends.
